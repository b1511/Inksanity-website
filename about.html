                    <h2>Where <br><span>It all started</span></h2>
                    <p>The owner and creator of tattoo studio “Inksanity” is Sallam Ahmadi. Several years ago he started
                        a
                        small business in the barber industry, but deep in his heart it was not what he truly desired.
                        <br><br>

                        In time, he finds passion in drawing and that turns out to be the game changer for him. This
                        passion
                        of his leads to the life-changing decision - to open a tattoo studio in Northern Denmark.
